# Comparative-Analysis-of-DNA-Sequences-Using-Ramanujan-Fourier-Transform
# Introduction
This is a novel alignment-free computational method for sequence analysis based on Ramanujan-Fourier transform (RFT), in which complete information of DNA sequences is retained. The results of applying the method on similarity analysis and  hierarchical clustering of DNA sequences demonstrate that the  RFT-based method is accurate and effective in DNA sequence comparison.

# Database
 You can refer this site to have more databases of different organisms for computation www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank. Examples on which the following result is obtained are AE005674.1', 'BA000016.3', 'CP002297.1'

# Algorithm
Established an effective similarity measure of DNA sequences based on RFT. Perform RFT on DNA sequence after converting symbolic sequences to four binary indicator sequences. Euclidean distance is used to calculate the similarity of RFT coefficients. Conducte different DNA sequence mutants and assess the accuracy of the new RFT metric on the mutants. The similarity metrics is then evaluated by constructing phylogenetic trees of virus at gene levels.

# Commands
